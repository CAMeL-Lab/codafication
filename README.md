# CODAfication


This repo contains code and pretrained models to reproduce the results in our paper [Exploiting Dialect Identification
in Automatic Dialectal Text Normalization]().


## Requirements:

The code was written for python>=3.9, pytorch 1.11.1, and transformers 4.22.2. You will need a few additional packages. Here's how you can set up the environment using conda (assuming you have conda and cuda installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/codafication.git
cd coda

conda create -n coda python=3.9
conda activate coda

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiments and Reproducibility:



## Hugging Face Integration:
We make our CODAfication models publicly available on [Hugging Face]().
